# Other Tools for Named Entity Recognition

As mentioned in the lesson, SpaCy is not the only NLP game in town! Numerous other tools exist that include NER components. They may approach the question of how to identify named entities similarly and even employ the same algorithms but the annotated output can vary between tools based on design decisions made by developers, the representativeness (or lack thereof) of the training data and so on.

If you will be working with a large number of documents, you may wish to investigate other tools with a small sample from your corpus before establishing a workflow with SpaCy in the event that they are more suitable for your purposes "out of the box."
