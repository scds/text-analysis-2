# Workshop preparation 

Preparation for this tutorial consists of two steps: [Getting the data](#get-the-data) and [Getting the software](#get-the-software). Follow the steps below. 
  
## 1. Get the data

We will be working with Mary Wollstonecraft’s “Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark” for the hands-on lesson, which can be [accessed from Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3529). You may download it directly from Project Gutenberg (select the [Plain Txt UTF-8](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3529.txt.utf-8) version).

Alternatively, you can download [a copy of the same document] with the preamble and the license terms removed.

## 2.  Get the software

This workshop uses the Python programming language, and the SpaCy library in particular. We will be  Spyder / PyCharm

If you have the [Anaconda platform](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) installed on your computer, you can access Spyder from the Anaconda Navigator interface. Anaconda's package manager may ask you to install or update Spyder if you have not opened it before or used it in a while.

## 3. Assemble your own corpus (optional)

In advance of the lesson, we also recommend that you assemble a collection of documents to work with for the *Try it with your data* sections. We will use the text  provided above to practice the techniques demonstrated in the lesson but each dataset brings its own unique features. Even if you are not going through the lesson with a specific project in mind, having a different corpus to experiment with will help to reinforce the concepts and enrich your knowledge of the topic.

If you have not already gone through your corpus to get a sense of what errors it might contain, now is a good time! If proper names are misspelled, they may not be identified through named entity recognition or counted with other instances of the same (correctly spelled) name.
