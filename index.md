# Identifying Proper Nouns with Named Entity Recognition
(in development)

**Identifying Proper Nouns with Named Entity Recognition belongs to a series of workshops on computational text analysis.**

Named entity recognition (NER) identifies words that may be names, places, or organizations within unstructured text. It can support exploratory data analysis, highlighting entities for further investigation through close reading. In this module, we will explore how NER works and apply it to a text corpus.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, learners will be able to:
* Describe how NER identifies possible entities within a text corpus
* Identify potential names, places and organizations using NER tools
* Explain why different NER tools may produce different results from each other
