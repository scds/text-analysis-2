# Named Entity Recognition

## Lesson roadmap

1. How does named entity recognition (NER) work?
2. Installing SpaCy
3. Creating the *Doc* object
4. Visualizing named entities
5. Identifying key terms
6. Fine-tuning SpaCy (optional)

## Lesson format

The hands-on components of the lesson are available as videos with written instructions and screenshots of the video content below. If you are newer to programming, you are encouraged to watch the videos and use the written sections for later reference but feel free to approach the lesson however you prefer!

Note: the screenshots are taken on a Windows OS while the video is filmed on a Mac to provide most of our learners with recognizable examples (with apologies to Linux users!).

## Lesson prerequisites

While a familiarity with basic programming concepts - such as variables, comments and the importance of correct syntax - will be an asset in completing the lesson, the videos explain the code in greater depth if you are newer to programming, or a bit rusty. If you have experience writing programs in Python, you will be able to move through the lesson quite quickly - you may wish to go directly to the [finished script](assets/ner.py).
