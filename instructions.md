# Workshop preparation 
<br />
Preparing for the lesson requires you to:

## 1. Get the data
The document we will be working with in the lesson is "[Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3529)" by Mary Wollstonecraft from Project Gutenberg: 

1. Go to the [HTML text copy of the document](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3529/3529-h/3529-h.htm),
2. Copy the text (ctrl/cmd + A to select all, then ctrl/cmd + C to copy) and,
3. Paste into a text file (create one using Notepad on a Windows OS or TextEdit on a Mac and then ctrl/cmd + V to paste) and save with a .txt extension as wollstonecraft.txt.
4. Remove the preamble 


## 2. Get the software
We will be exploring several approaches to named entity recognition using a browser-based tool, Python and R. You can choose the approach you are most comfortable with - for example, if you have experience with R - or you can explore all three if you would like to further develop your skills.

Each lesson will go through the installation of the required software; links are provided below for quick reference.

   [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
   
   [Download R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

Please contact the [Sherman Centre](mailto:scds@mcmaster.ca) if you have any difficulties downloading or opening the software.

## 3. Assemble your own corpus (optional)
In advance of the workshop, we also recommend that you assemble a collection of documents to work with for the *Try it with your data* sections. We will use the text collection, or corpus, provided above to practice the techniques demonstrated in the lesson but each dataset brings its own unique set of challenges. Even if you are not going through the lesson with a specific project in mind, having a different corpus to experiment with will help to reinforce the concepts and enrich your knowledge of the topic.
